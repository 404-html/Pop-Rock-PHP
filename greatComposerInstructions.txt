Ok, so anyone coming to this tread with the same issue the steps to install php-pdftk are:

	1.	install pdftk
	2.	install composer
	3.	download/clone php-pdftk to where ever you want to use it
	4.	open php-pdftk in terminal and run command > composer install
	5.	then in your php script add - require_once( '/path/to/php-pdftk-master/vendor/autoload.php' );
	6.	and - use mikehaertl\pdftk\Pdf;
